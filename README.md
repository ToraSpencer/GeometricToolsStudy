## About ##

The Geometric Tools Engine is a collection of source code for computing in
the fields of mathematics, geometry, graphics, image analysis and physics.
The engine is written in C++ 14 and supports high-performance computing
using CPU multithreading and general purpose GPU programming (GPGPU).
Portions of the code are described in various books as well as in PDF
documents available at the
[Geometric Tools Website](https://www.geometrictools.com).

The Geometric Tools Engine is licensed under the
[Boost Software License 1.0](https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt).

## Supported Platforms ##

The mathematics code is in a header-only library, GTMathematics. A
mathematics library with GPU-based implementations is provided,
GTMathematicsGPU. The CPU-based common graphics engine code is in its
own library, GTGraphics. DirectX 11 wrappers are provided for graphics
and applications, GTGraphicsDX11 and GTApplicationsDX11, on Microsoft
Windows 10. OpenGL 4.5 wrappers are provided for graphics and
applications, GTGraphicsGL45 and GTApplicationsGL45, on Microsoft
Windows 10 and on Linux. A small number of files exist to use GLX
and X-Windows on Linux.

On Microsoft Windows 10, the code is maintained using Microsoft Visual
Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 with Microsoft's compilers or with Intel
C++ Compilers 17, 18 and 19.1.

On Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS, the code is maintained using Visual Studio Code
1.49.2 and CMake 3.15.2, NVIDIA graphics drivers, OpenGL 4.5 and
gcc 9.3.0, 

On Fedora 34, the code is maintained using Visual Studio Code 1.49.2
and CMake 3.18.3, NVIDIA graphics drivers, OpenGL 4.5 and
gcc 11.1.1.

## Getting Started ##

The repository contains many sample applications to illustrate some
features of the engine. Top-level solutions/makefiles exist to build
everything in the repository. Please read the installation and release
notes to understand what is expected of your development environment.
